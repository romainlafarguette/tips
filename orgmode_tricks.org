* Update and sync from the remote github repository
Assuming that the local repo has been properly initialized (see below)
- git fetch --all
- git reset --hard origin/master
- git pull origin master

* Commands and installation
** Installation
- Need to have pandoc installed (https://pandoc.org/installing.html)
- Also download pandoc-crossref which should be either in the path or in the
  same folder as the file
  (https://github.com/lierdakil/pandoc-crossref/releases)
- Then open a windows terminal in the same folder as the .org (or .md file)
  and type the following commands, (assuming the file is called
  orgmode-tricks.org). Change the extensions are needed

** Commands in Windows shell (need in the same folder as the file)
*** With cross-reference, bibliography and default style 
pandoc -F pandoc-crossref -F pandoc-citeproc --bibliography biblio.bib -s orgmode_tricks.org -o output.docx

*** Without cross-reference, but with bibliography and default style 
pandoc  -F pandoc-citeproc --bibliography biblio.bib -s orgmode_tricks.org -o output.docx

*** With cross-references, bibliography and bibliographystyle (csl file in folder)
pandoc -F pandoc-crossref -F pandoc-citeproc --bibliography biblio.bib --csl chicago-fullnote-bibliography.csl orgmode_tricks.org -o output.docx

*** With cross-references no bibliography:
pandoc -F pandoc-crossref -F pandoc-citeproc orgmode-file.org -o output.docx

*** To use a Word template to generate another Word document
pandoc --reference-doc template.docx -o output.docx orgmode-file.org

** Create a windows script to automatize opening Word, etc.
   In Emacs:
   - M-x shell
   - powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy bypass 
   - \my_script.ps1

Note: to open a Word document in a script, just:
start my_doc.docx

* TOC and TOL
#+TOC: listings           build a list of listings
#+TOC: tables             build a list of tables

* BLock comments

#+BEGIN_COMMENT

Need to leave a space before and after
BLablabliubilub
oirneoqignorein

#+END_COMMENT

* Basic syntax
** New line
Here I put a new line\\

** Paragraphs
Paragraphs are separated by at least one empty line.

** Page breaks
The easiest is to configure Word to have automatically a page break before
each Heading 1 section https://wordmvp.com/FAQs/Formatting/PageBreakBeforeHeading.htm

Tricks to have a pagebreak anywhere in the document: just use empty * and word
will automatically break the page !

** Fonts
Available fonts style:
- *bold*      
- /italic/  (also \emph{} for large paragraphs)
-_underlined_
- =code=
- ~verbatim~
- +strikethrough+

** Description
[[http://Karl-Voit.at][Link description]] [[link in html][]]

http://Karl-Voit.at â†’ link without description

** Lists
- list item
- another item
  - sub-item
    1. also enumerated
    2. if you like
- [ ] yet to be done
- [X] item which is done

# Pay attention at the :: in description lists
   My favorite scenes are (in this order)
   1. The attack of the Rohirrim
   2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
      + this was already my favorite scene in the book
      + I really like Miranda Otto.
   3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
      - on DVD only
      He makes a really funny face when it happens.
   But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.
   Important actors in this film are:
   - Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo
   - Sean Astin :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.  I still remember
     him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in The Goonies.

** Code text
: Simple pre-formatted text such as for source code.
: This also respects the line breaks. *bold* is not bold here.

** Symbols 
Just insert as \pound or \gamma

* List of acronmys
# Easier to put it in a table actually
| *HKD*  | Hong Kong Dollar |
| *HKMA* | Hong Kong Monetary Authority |
| *LERS* | Linked Exchange Rate System |

* Footnotes 
A footnote is created like this [fn:1] (use C-c C-c to jump between definition
and reference).  Can  have a new section at the  end called footnote (start
with one *) to store them

[fn:1] Please refer to X and Y (2019)

* Tables: least bad way so far

Pay attention ! The label should be in at least two parts tbl:one-two

https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/tables.html

- For tables, just start to type the first row and the line
|Name|Phone|Age|
|-
- Then TAB to align and fill the table
- To create a line between rows, just C-c -

#+CAPTION: Percentage of literate men and women, by country (per cent)

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |   |        |   |

|----------+----------+----------+---+--------+---|
|----------+----------+----------+---+--------+---|


Another solution: separate  different items with comma, select  the region and
C-c | (pay attention, with the capital |): will create the table

some, comma separated, value

Then C-c - to create a new row

Table example  to manage export under  word, with grouping and  alignment Note
the extra column on the left and the extra row in orange: parameters
|   |  N | N^2 | N^3 | N^4 | sqrt(n) | sqrt[4](N) |

Prefixed with the Shift  key, these command will insert a new  column or a new
row, instead of  moving it.  For example,  with the cursor initially  in the B
cell, S-M-<right> will insert a new column between A and B

* Mathematics
hello $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} \ = \ [ln x]_{-\infty}^{\infty}$

\[e^x = 4\]

$$f(x) =  \sum\limits_0^\infty(f^{(n)}(x)|_{x=0} \cdot x)$${#eq:super} 

See my nice equation [@eq:super]

The scaling for 1.3 airmasses is src_python{1.3**(3.0/5.0)} 

 You can toggle symbols over these commands with this command: elisp:org-toggle-pretty-entities or C-c C-x .
* Figures
  
PS: Need to use an HTML attribute for  scaling so that it renders well on Word
Note: it seems that the other options of HTML for exporting to work don't work
with my current pandoc at the IMF (2.2.3)

#+CAPTION: Google NGrams Viewer Searches
#+LABEL: fig:ngrams
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500
[[file:ngrams.png]]

Pay attention ! Put the extension (.png, .jpg) not capitalized

With local references, should be written as '['[./img/a.jpg']'] (remove ')

Please refer to [@Fig:ngrams] for more details

* Section with cross reference
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:one
:END:

Please refer to [@Sec:one] for more details

* Remove prefix in cross reference with -@

Please refer to Table [-@tbl:super-table2] for the level of underdevelopment.

* Multiple prefixs (Tables 1 and 2 instead of Table 1 and Table 2)
Please refer to Tables [-@tbl:super-table; -@tbl:super-table2] for a detailed explanation

* Citations with bibliography

# Pandoc with citeproc-hs

-   [@item1] says blah.

-   [@item1] [p. 30] says blah.

-   @item1 [p. 30, with suffix] says blah.

-   @item1 [-@item2 p. 30; see also @item3] says blah.

-   In a note.[^1]

-   A citation group [see @item1 p. 34-35; also @item3 chap. 3].

-   Another one [see @item1 p. 34-35].

-   And another one in a note.[^2]

-   Citation with a suffix and locator [@item1 pp. 33, 35-37, and nowhere else].

-   Citation with suffix only [@item1 and nowhere else].

-   Now some modifiers.[^3]

-   With some markup [*see* @item1 p. **32**].

[^1]: A citation without locators [@item3].

[^2]: Some citations [see @item2 chap. 3; @item3; @item1].

[^3]: Like a citation without author: [-@item1], and now Doe with a locator [-@item2 p. 44].

#+begin_src python :exports none :session :results output
  # df = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2, 3],
  #                    'b': [4, 5, 6]})
  # df_len_columns = len(df.columns)
  # df_len_cases = len(df.index)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

# The result of my computation is src_python[:session]{print(df_len_columns)}


#+MACRO: 
# - Inline code src_python[:results output]{return(2*2)} {{{results(=4=)}}}

* Center text
It seems that it doesn't work either...
#+BEGIN_CENTER
Everything should be made as simple as possible, \\
but not any simpler
#+END_CENTER
